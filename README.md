üß† Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
Automatic classification of MRI scans to detect the presence of brain tumors.
This project utilizes Deep Learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to develop an automated system for classifying MRI brain scans as either containing a tumor or being tumor-free. This system aims to assist medical professionals by providing a fast, preliminary, and objective analysis tool to improve diagnostic efficiency and support early detection.

‚ú® Key Features
Deep Learning Model: Implements a robust [Enter your model name here, e.g., Custom CNN, ResNet50, EfficientNet] architecture.

High Accuracy: Achieved a test accuracy of approximately [Enter your final accuracy here, e.g., 96.5%] on the test dataset.

Binary Classification: Classifies MRI images into two categories: Tumor Present (Positive) and No Tumor (Negative).

Data Augmentation: Utilizes techniques like rotation, shifting, and zooming to artificially increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, improving model generalization.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries
